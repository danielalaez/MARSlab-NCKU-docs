# MARSlab-NCKU-docs

The following repository contains all the projects developed for MARSlab, divided into scripts and documentation. The documentation contains the following guides:

1. [Setup the VICON Tracker to output Real-Time position in Simulink](https://github.com/danielalaez/MARSlab-NCKU-docs/blob/main/docs/VICONTrackerRealTimeMatlab.md) (Matlab), including integrations for external radio input and an interface to control radio signals sent to the flapping wing.
2. [Setup the VICON Tracker to output Real-Time position in Python](https://github.com/danielalaez/MARSlab-NCKU-docs/blob/main/docs/VICONTrackerRealTimePython.md).
3. [Setup the FAWT and the webserver GUI](https://github.com/danielalaez/MARSlab-NCKU-docs/blob/main/docs/FAWT.md) to run experimental tests.
4. [Instructions for installing, configuring, running and recompiling the Crazyflie firmware for Bolt](https://github.com/danielalaez/MARSlab-NCKU-docs/blob/main/docs/CrazyflieBolt.md) (brushless) boards.
5. [Instructions for adapting the Crazyflie Bolt board to Flapping wing aircraft](https://github.com/danielalaez/MARSlab-NCKU-docs/blob/main/docs/CrazyflieBoltFlapping.md). *WIP*

This documentation was developed as part of my research stay at the NCKU in January 2025.
